# Advent of Code Solutions (advent-of-code-solutions)

My solutions to Advent of Code programming puzzles 
(<https://adventofcode.com/>). 
I download inputs using the Advent of Code Downloader by GreenLightning
(<https://github.com/GreenLightning/advent-of-code-downloader>).

## Prerequisites:

1. Python 3 (last tested with version 3.12.3)

## Getting Started:

```
git clone https://github.com/William-D-Jones/advent-of-code-solutions.git
```

## Usage:

Each Python program accepts a single command-line input, which is the name
of the file containing the day's input. For example, run 2024 day 1 with:

```
python3 2024/day1.py 2024/input-2024-1.txt
```

Most programs print two lines of output, which are the solutions to part 1
and part 2, respectively.
